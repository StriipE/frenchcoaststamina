            <ul class="bullet-list-odd">It uses songs in pack that consists in 2 divisions :
              <li class="fast-list-line"> A low (which can be called hope) division with song difficulties ranging from low-end 11 to upper 13.</li>
              <li class="fast-list-line"> A high division with song difficulties from low end 13 to 21 </li>

                <li class="list-line">Contestants can enter both divisions regardless of skill level.</li>
                <li class="list-line">The High pack is a compilation of ten 10-minutes long mixtapes I did myself from existing songs and charts in ITG with a few exclusives. It features all 5 difficulties.</li>
                <li class="list-line">The Low pack is a standard tournament pack with personal picks from other stepartists. Props to them here : stepartists</li>

        Well, at the moment, nothing special. The High Division pack is new, so you don't need to enter the competition to enjoy new and old charts compiled together.
    </p>
    <p class="prizes-paragraph">
        There may be some prizes if the tournament becomes successful but it will be kept at a minimum because it costs a lot to send prizes overseas unfortunately.

        But at least you get a lot of free content !

    So why should I participate ?
    1 - Get yourself on the map ! It is a good way to mesure your skills with foreign and local players.
    2 - Help creative people get a better grasp on dance games demographics ! Helping everyone to get a better idea on the playerbase of each country will certainly get you more good content in the future.
    3 - To push yourself. It is a new kind of stamina charts, and should help you push your boundaries.
    Additionally, these are more suited for public arcade play than the marathons you can find at the moment which are usually way longer than 10 minutes.

    Is this the new ECS thingy ?
    Nope ! The ECS X.5 tourneys definitely inspired the idea, and French Coast Stamina 1 was mimmicking ECS4, but was only ran in France. This is at this date independant from ECS.
    I had a few ideas about the new tournament I was trying to make, and the French community decided by vote that it should go international for the next edition, so here it is !
